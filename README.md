AWS Lex - A service for building conversational interfaces into any application using voice and text. This was used in combination with the functionality created on AWS Lambda.

Logging

Numpy - This provides the ability to work with arrays and use different mathematical calculations on arrays.

#### RoboAdvisor with an Amazon Lambda Function

1. Create a new Lambda function from scratch named recommendPortfolio, and use Python 3.7 as the runtime programming language. 

2. Complete the recommend_portfolio function by adding the requested validation rules. 

3. Successfully implement the investment recommendations evidenced by the accuracy of the bot’s response.
